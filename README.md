# MPs' Twitter Networks 
This project used Twitter's API to collect, visualise, and analyse data on how politicians interact on social media. 

All the code contained here is the cleaned up version of the code I used in my master's dissertation. This dissertation looked at how ideology and factional membership influence how MPs interact with each other on Twitter.

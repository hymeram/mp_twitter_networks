# MPs' Twitter Networks 
This project used Twitter's API to collect, visualise, and analyse data on how politicians interact on social media. 

The code contained here is the cleaned up version of some of the code I used for my master's dissertation. This dissertation looked at how ideology and factional membership influence how MPs interact with each other on Twitter.

### MPs' Twitter Like Network 
Here's the output of the script - the thickness of the edges indicate the number of times the MPs have liked each other's tweets. Colour indicates party membership.
